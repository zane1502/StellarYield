# StellarYield

> Notice: the original Vercel domain submitted during Drips Wave review was claimed by a squatter. The current live deployment is [stellaryield.vercel.app](https://stellaryield.vercel.app).

StellarYield is a Stellar-native DeFi dashboard and automated vault project. The repository includes a Vite frontend in `client/`, an Express backend in `server/`, and Soroban smart contracts in `contracts/`.

## Repository Layout

- `client/` - React + Vite frontend
- `server/` - Node.js + Express backend
- `contracts/` - Soroban smart contracts and Rust workspace
- `docs/` - contributor and release documentation
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - pull request validation workflow

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm 10+
- Rust stable toolchain
- Soroban CLI for contract work

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_NAME/StellarYield.git
cd StellarYield
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd client
npm ci
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

The frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173`.

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd server
npm ci
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

The backend runs on `http://localhost:3001`.

#### Environment Variables

- `STELLAR_HORIZON_TIMEOUT_MS`: Timeout for Horizon API calls in milliseconds (default: `10000`)
- `SOROBAN_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS`: Timeout for Soroban RPC API calls in milliseconds (default: `10000`)
  The example env files document required and optional values. Keep real secrets
  out of git; frontend values must be public `VITE_` values only.

The backend also performs startup environment validation (warnings in development, errors in production). For CI-parity examples of **minimum env vars for backend tests** (including `DATABASE_URL`) and common validation failures, see [docs/backend_testing.md](./docs/backend_testing.md).

For the **full list of `VITE_` variables the client reads** — including required values, contract IDs, optional integrations, and a production deployment checklist — see [docs/frontend-env-reference.md](./docs/frontend-env-reference.md).

### API Documentation

The backend provides OpenAPI documentation:

- **Interactive Swagger UI**: http://localhost:3001/api/openapi/docs
- **Raw OpenAPI spec (YAML)**: http://localhost:3001/api/openapi

These are automatically available when the backend is running. The Swagger UI provides a visual, interactive interface to explore all API endpoints, request parameters, and response schemas.

### Contract Verification

```bash
cd contracts
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

## Verification Commands

### Client

```bash
cd client
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run test
```

### Server

```bash
cd server
npm run lint
npm run build
npm test
```

### Contracts

```bash
cd contracts
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

### README Verification

The CI workflow also checks that the documented setup and verification commands in this README stay in sync with the repo:

```bash
node scripts/verify-readme-commands.js
```

## CI Failure Artifacts

When the pull request workflow fails, GitHub Actions uploads frontend failure artifacts and contract test logs for a short retention window. Open the failed workflow run in the GitHub Actions tab and look for the **Artifacts** section near the bottom of the run summary.

## Vercel Deployment Settings

The frontend is deployed via Vercel. To avoid the recurring `client/client/...` path failures that have appeared in past preview deployments, the Vercel project must be configured against the `client/` directory and not the repository root. The committed `vercel.json` already encodes the install, build, and output paths _relative to that root_, so misconfiguring the Vercel root re-introduces the doubled path.

Use these values when creating or auditing the Vercel project:

| Setting          | Value               |
| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Framework Preset | Vite                |
| Root Directory   | `client`            |
| Install Command  | `npm ci --no-audit` |
| Build Command    | `npm run build`     |
| Output Directory | `dist`              |
| Node.js Version  | 20.x                |

For a full breakdown of how local, preview, and production environments differ — including backend assumptions and common failure modes — see [docs/deployment-environment-matrix.md](./docs/deployment-environment-matrix.md).

These match the committed [`vercel.json`](./vercel.json) at the repository root. Vercel resolves the install/build/output paths _inside_ the configured Root Directory, so leaving the root unset (or pointing it at the repo root) makes Vercel run `npm run build` from a folder that has no `build` script.

Preview deployments must define `VITE_API_BASE_URL` or `VITE_API_URL` in Vercel. Without one of those values, the client intentionally avoids falling back to `http://localhost:3001` and API-backed views should report that the backend is unavailable.

### Troubleshooting

- **Build fails with `client/client/...` paths.** The Vercel Root Directory is set to the repo root instead of `client`. Update the project settings, redeploy, and confirm the build logs now start with `Running install command: npm ci --no-audit` inside `client/`.
- **Preview deployment fails while production succeeds (or vice versa).** Compare the **Environment Variables** scoped to Production vs Preview in the Vercel dashboard. Frontend builds only see variables prefixed `VITE_`; anything else is invisible to the client bundle. Re-promote a known-good build from the **Deployments** tab while you investigate.
- **Custom domain stuck on a stale deployment.** Re-promote the desired deployment from the Vercel dashboard or roll back via the **Deployments → … → Promote to Production** menu. See [`docs/release-checklist.md`](./docs/release-checklist.md) for the documented rollback path.
- **Missing assets in production.** Confirm the asset lives under `client/public/` (served at the site root) or is imported from `client/src/` so Vite bundles it. Assets placed at the repo root are not picked up by the build.

## Contributor and Release Docs

The mock API will be available at http://localhost:3001

## 🧪 Post-deploy smoke test

After deploying the frontend + backend, run the included smoke test to validate basic reachability.

```bash
FRONTEND_URL="https://your-frontend-url" \
BACKEND_URL="https://your-backend-url" \
bash scripts/smoke-test.sh
```

- **Checks**: `GET /api/yields`, `GET /api/metrics`, and the frontend root.
- **Config**: `FRONTEND_URL` and `BACKEND_URL` environment variables.

## ✅ Post-deploy smoke tests

After merge/deploy, you can quickly verify the public app + API are reachable:

```bash
# Unix/Linux/macOS (Bash)
npm run smoke-test

# Windows/Cross-platform (Node.js)
npm run smoke-test:node
```

### Configuration

Override targets via environment variables:

```bash
# Unix/Linux/macOS
FRONTEND_URL="https://stellaryield.vercel.app" \
BACKEND_URL="https://your-backend.example.com" \
npm run smoke-test

# Windows PowerShell
$env:FRONTEND_URL="https://stellaryield.vercel.app"
$env:BACKEND_URL="https://your-backend.example.com"
npm run smoke-test:node

# Windows Command Prompt
set FRONTEND_URL=https://stellaryield.vercel.app
set BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend.example.com
npm run smoke-test:node
```

Optional path overrides:

- `BACKEND_HEALTH_PATH` (default: `/api/health`)
- `BACKEND_YIELDS_PATH` (default: `/api/yields`)
- `FRONTEND_ASSET_PATH` (default: `/favicon.svg`)

### CI Usage

Both smoke test variants support the same environment variables and produce identical output. The Node.js version (`smoke-test:node`) is recommended for CI environments and Windows contributors as it has no Bash dependency.
