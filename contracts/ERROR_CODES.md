# Contract Error Code Reference

All Soroban contracts in this repository use the `#[contracterror]` macro with `#[repr(u32)]` error enums. When a contract call fails, the SDK surfaces the numeric error code. This document maps each code to its meaning and remediation steps.

> No contract behavior is changed by this document. It is reference-only.

## Panic Paths

In addition to typed errors, contracts may call `panic_with_error!` or `panic!` for invariant violations. These surface as generic transaction failures without a typed code. Common causes:

- Passing `Address::default()` or a zero-length `Bytes` where a real value is required.
- Calling admin-only functions without the correct admin address in storage.
- Integer overflow in unchecked arithmetic (rare; most paths use checked math).

When you see an untyped panic, check the function's precondition guards at the top of the call.
